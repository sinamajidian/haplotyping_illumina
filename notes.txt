Haptree v1 is only for diploid. To make it a standard approach, it's better to use version V0.1 for both diploid and polyploid.


You can use

https://github.com/EhsanMotazedi/Haplosim/blob/master/FragmentPoly.py

for converting a fragment file to a dictionary format.


You can see the examples of the input format in the Examples files in their website:

http://cb.csail.mit.edu/cb/haptree/  

Make sure that your are downloading the correct version.


I suggest you to work on diploid to make sure that the whole pipeline is working properly.






For running FragmentPoly.py,  you may use

python2 FragmentPoly.py-f frag_in.txt -o frag_dic.txt -x HapTree

in order to convert the output of extracthairs to haptree's input and

python2 FragmentPoly.py-f frag_in.txt -o frag_dic.txt -x SDhaP

in order to convert the output of extracthairs to sdhap's input.


I'm not sure that it's working on python3. 


For installing packages for different python versions, I use the following. 
python2 -m pip install package_name  --user
python3 -m pip install package_name  --user 




I just remember another issue.


For  polypoids illumina data, you should put an edited VCF-file as the input of extracthairs.

You should change the polyploid genotype of vcf file to a diploid one. That's the trick!

So, both genotypes 0/0/1 and  0/1/1 should be converted to 0/1.

sed  raw.vcf "s/0\/0\/1/0\/1/;s/0\/1\/1/0\/1/" > edited.vcf

If you do not edit the vcf file, extracthairs consider the genotype 0/0/1 as homozygous which is not

heterogeneous.


Note that only heterogeneous variant exitst in the extracthairs' output.


For 10x data we are using another Ehsan's code for creating fragment files which uses the barcodes.
